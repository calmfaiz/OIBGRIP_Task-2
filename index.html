        <h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
        <p>M S Dhoni, a boy from Ranchi, aspires to play cricket for India. Though he initially tries to please his
          father by working for the Indian Railways, he ultimately decides to chase his dreams..</p>
        <h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
        <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family with roots in
          Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is
          in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to
          Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony
          situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.
          Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing
          his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to
          play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular
          wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked
          for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well
          From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South
          Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.</p>

        <h3><strong>Early career</strong></h3>
        <h4><strong>Junior cricket in Bihar</strong></h4>
        <p>n 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi
          District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till 1998 Dhoni, who was
          in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the
          order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division. Deval Sahay, impressed
          by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team. Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior
          Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.

          In the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7
          innings). However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni
          was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy
          and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the
          finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of 357. Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by
          Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358. Dhoni's contribution in the tournament
          included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings. Dhoni made it to the East
          Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the 1999–2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as
          East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament..</p>
        <h4><strong>India A team</strong></h4>
        <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for
          the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni
          had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. In the tri-nation
          tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223
          against Pakistan A with a half-century. Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries
          – 120 and 119* – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and
          his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly and Ravi
          Shastri, amongst others. </p>
        <h3><strong>International career</strong></h3>
        <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper
          spot didn't lack in batting talent. The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior
          ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.
          With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in
          2004/05. Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of
          an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.
          Breakthrough
          In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off
          only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian
          wicket-keeper, a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.
          Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series
          (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (Jaipur). Sri
          Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar
          early.
          ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006, becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings. His reign
          lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.
          Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to
          security concerns and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,
          was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team
          lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006
          ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century against
          West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored
          139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From the start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had
          played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping
          technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani. Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World
          ODI XI by the ICC </p>
        <h3><strong>Selection As Captain </strong></h3>

        <p>Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West
          Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.

          India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage.
          Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to
          Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was
          vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM. The local police arranged for security for his family as
          India exited the World Cup in the first round.

          Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh, after
          India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his
          performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game
          of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of
          87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.

          Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent
          India-England seven-match ODI series. Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded
          an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. He was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World
          Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record
          for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one. </p>
        <h3><strong> Cool Captain </strong></h3>
        <p> MS Dhoni, the man who personified the image of an "ideal leader", is widely considered one of the finest
          captains the game of cricket has seen. Nicknamed 'Captain Cool', the way Dhoni handled cricketing affairs on
          the field became a benchmark for budding players.
          Some former cricketers still give the example of Dhoni as they explain how an ideal captain should be on the
          field. But what makes Dhoni so calm and composed? The former India skipper has explained the reasoning behind
          his approach himself. </p>
